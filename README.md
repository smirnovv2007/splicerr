# <img src="./src-tauri/icons/128x128.png" width="64"/> Splice

**Splice** is an alternative frontend for the popular [Splice](https://splice.com/features/sounds) sample library. It does not require any authentication and contains all of the most important features of the regular desktop app (including drag-and-drop).

It's basically a full rewrite of [ascpixi's](https://github.com/ascpixi) [Splicedd ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://github.com/ascpixi/splicedd), just with a couple more features and built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Tauri 2.0](https://v2.tauri.app/).

Please show your appreciation by starring ‚≠ê the [original project](https://github.com/ascpixi/splicedd), as it made this all possible.
